## Information about the data:
The attributes in the data provided are as follows: 
● account length 
● international plan 
● voicemail plan 
● number of voicemail messages 
● total day minutes used 
● day calls made 
● total day charge 
● total evening minutes 
● total evening calls 
● total evening charge 
● total night minutes 
● total night calls 
● total night charge 
● total international minutes used 
● total international calls made 
● total international charge  
● number of customer service calls made 
● Churn: if the customer has moved (1=yes; 0 = no)


## Problem Statement
The objective of this Case is to predict customer behaviour. We are providing you a public dataset that has customer usage pattern and if the customer has moved or not. We expect you to develop an algorithm to predict the churn score based on usage pattern.

## Findings of EDA:
No missing values present in the dataset. 

## Models used:
